 - Just upload a wav file, transcribe it, and download the
   transcription! ðŸ™Œ
 - **Use cases**: call centres, team meetings, training videos, school
   calls etc...
 - Model-wise, it's using the [Wav2Vec](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2) model via [HuggingFace's API inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).

For the curious, I wrote a quick post about its implementation [here](https://www.charlywargnier.com/post/how-to-create-a-zero-shot-learning-text-classifier-using-hugging-face-and-streamlit).
